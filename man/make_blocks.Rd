\title{Block-wise split data into training and testing}
\usage{
make_blocks(
  nfolds = 5,
  df = data.frame(),
  nblocks = nfolds * 2,
  npoints = NA,
  pres = numeric()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{nfolds}{Numeric. Number of approximately equal-sized classes (folds) to separate groups in block-cross
validation.}

\item{df}{Object of class 'data.frame' with n columns containing critera for cluster building.
Not necessary if argument npoints is supplied.}

\item{nblocks}{Number of clusters (blocks) based on the number of folds that should be built.
Minimum is the same number as 'nFolds'. Maximum is nrow(df)/10.}

\item{npoints}{Optional argument if 'df' is not supplied. For how many points should random sampling be made?}

\item{pres}{Binary vector. Optional argument. If 'df' is supplied, this argument can be used to
save processing time. '1' stands for the points on which CLARA is appplied, and '0' stands for
the points on which K-nearest neighbors is applied relative to the '1'. If 'df' is not supplied,
for which points should random sampling be made?}
}
\value{
Object of class 'vector' of length nrow(df) or 'npoints', with integers defining
different folds.
}
\description{
Creates a stratum vector based on a data.frame with n columns. If the data.frame
has one column, strata vector is created based on clusters separated by quantiles. If
the data.frame has two or more columns, strata vector is created based on 'Clustering
Large Applications' (function 'clara' from package cluster). Also, instead of a data.frame
the argument 'npoints' can be provided, which create groups by random sampling. An
opitimization algorithm (function 'gridSearch' from package NMOF) optimizes for equal stratum sizes.
